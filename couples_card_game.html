                    <p>4. <strong>PHYSICAL COMFORT:</strong> Use pillows or support for positions to avoid strain. Ensure both partners are relaxed and comfortable.</p>
                    <p>5. <strong>LUBRICATION:</strong> Use water-based lubricant for any penetrative activities to enhance comfort and reduce friction.</p>
                    <p>6. <strong>ALLERGIES:</strong> Check for allergies to oils, lubricants, or materials before using them.</p>
                    <p>7. <strong>PACING:</strong> Start slowly with intense activities to gauge comfort levels and avoid discomfort.</p>
